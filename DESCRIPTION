Title: Selective Inference for Linear Regression with F-Screening
Version: 0.1.1

Description: F-screening a common two step procedure in the context of least squares linear
  regression. The first step of F-screening is to conduct an overall F-test that tests whether all of the coefficients
  in the linear model are zero (excluding the intercept). If this null hypothesis is rejected, the second step is to
  conduct inference on individual coefficients in the model. If instead the null hypothesis is not rejected,
  no further inference is conducted. If step 2 in F-screening is conducted without accounting for step 1, 
  statistical guarantees such as type 1 error control and nominal confidence interval coverage
  break down. As a solution, the paper ["Valid F-screening in linear regression"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23113) develops p-values,
  confidence intervals, and point estimates to use in step 2 that condition on the rejection of the overall F-test 
  in step 1. This package provides functions to implement these methods.
