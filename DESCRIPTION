Title: Selective Inference for Linear Regression with F-Screening
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Olivia McGough
Maintainer: Olivia McGough <mcgougho@uw.edu>
Description: Implements selective inference for least squares linear regression
    models in scenarios where the overall null hypothesis is first tested using
    an F-statistic. The package computes valid selective p-values, confidence
    intervals, and estimates while accounting for selection bias introduced by
    conditioning on rejection of the overall null hypothesis.
