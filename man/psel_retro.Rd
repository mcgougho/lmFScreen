\usage{
psel_retro(
  n,
  p,
  R_squared,
  RSE,
  Fstat,
  sigma_sq = NULL,
  alpha_ov = 0.05,
  B = 10000,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Sample size (number of observations).}

\item{p}{Number of predictors of interest (non-intercept) in the model.}

\item{R_squared}{R-squared value from the overall fitted model.}

\item{RSE}{Residual standard error from the overall fitted model.}

\item{Fstat}{Observed F-statistic for the post-hoc.}

\item{sigma_sq}{Optional variance parameter. If NULL, it will be estimated using debiased estimate.}

\item{alpha_ov}{Significance level for the overall F-test (default: 0.05).}

\item{B}{Number of Monte Carlo samples per attempt (default: 10000).}

\item{min_select}{Minimum number of selected samples required to compute the p-value (default: 100).}

\item{max_attempts}{Maximum number of sampling attempts if the selection condition is rare (default: 10).}
}
\value{
A scalar value: the estimated selective p-value. If no selected samples are obtained
after `max_attempts`, returns NA with a warning.
}
\description{
Computes the selective p-value for a linear regression coefficient from R squared, RSE
and the post-hoc F-statistic of interest, conditional on having passed an overall F-test.
