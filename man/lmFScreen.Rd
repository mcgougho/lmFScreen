\title{lmFScreen: Selective Inference for Linear Regression via F-screening}
\usage{
lmFScreen(
  formula,
  data,
  alpha = 0.05,
  alpha_ov = 0.05,
  sigma_sq = NULL,
  seed = NULL,
  compute_CI = TRUE,
  compute_est = TRUE,
  B = 1e+05
)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{A formula specifying the linear model (e.g., y ~ x1 + x2).}

\item{data}{An optional data frame containing the variables in the model.}

\item{alpha}{Significance level for confidence intervals and hypothesis tests (default: 0.05).}

\item{alpha_ov}{Significance level for the overall F-test used for screening (default: 0.05).}

\item{sigma_sq}{Optional noise variance. If NULL, it is estimated using a corrected residual variance.}

\item{seed}{Optional seed for reproducibility.}

\item{compute_CI}{Logical; whether to compute selective confidence intervals (default: TRUE).}

\item{compute_est}{Logical; whether to compute selective point estimates (default: TRUE).}

\item{B}{Number of Monte Carlo samples used for selective inference (default: 100000).}
}
\value{
An object of class lmFScreen, which includes:

  - Selective coefficients, confidence intervals, and p-values

  - Naive (unadjusted) estimates, confidence intervals, and p-values

  - Model-level settings such as alpha and alpha_ov
}
\description{
Fits a selective inference linear regression model using an R formula interface.
If an intercept is present in the model, the data are projected to remove the intercept
before conducting inference.
}
\details{
This function performs the following steps:

1. Converts the formula into a model matrix and response vector.

2. Projects out the intercept if one is included in the formula.

3. Calls lmFScreen.fit to compute selective inference results for all predictors.
