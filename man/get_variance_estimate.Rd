\title{Estimate Variance for Selective Inference}
\usage{
get_variance_estimate(X, Y, alpha_ov)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix of predictor variables with n rows and p columns.}

\item{Y}{A numeric response vector of length n.}

\item{alpha_ov}{The significance level used in the overall F-test.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the estimated variance used for selective inference.
}
\description{
Computes an estimate of the error variance to be used in selective inference,
based on a rescaled residual sum of squares from a linear regression model.
}
\details{
This function estimates the variance of the error term under the assumption that
inference is performed conditional on rejection of the overall F-test.
